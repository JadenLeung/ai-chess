<h3>Description</h3>

Select between GPT-4o-mini, Gemini, Stockfish 15, Randombot, and yourself to compete in a chess game! <br/>

Additionally, you can strengthen both Gemini/GPT by adjusting the stockfish percentage, representing the chance that stockfish takes over Gemini/GPT's moves. <br/>

This backend code can be found in https://github.com/JadenLeung/flask-chess

<h3>Simulation Data</h3>
All data of simulation games can be found in aichessdata.json <br>
Here are some of the highlights: <br/>

  Simulations: 50<br/>
</h4>
GPT wins: 31 <br/>
Gemini wins: 10 <br/>
Stalemate: 1 <br/>
Threefold repetition: 4 <br/>
Insufficient Materilal: 4  <br/><br/>
<h4>
  White: GPT, Black: Gemini, Stockfish: 50%<br/>
  Simulations: 50<br/>

</h4>
GPT wins: 35 <br/>
Gemini wins: 7 <br/>
Stalemate: 7 <br/>
Threefold repetition: 1 <br/>
